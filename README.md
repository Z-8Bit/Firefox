# Firefox CSS
_Just me forking other people's userChrome CSS and modifying it to my liking._

## Installation

1. In the searchbar, type `about:config`. A dialog will be shown to you. Press the **I accept the risk** button.
2. Search for **`toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets`** and change it to **True**.
3. Go to your Firefox profile:
   - In the searchbar, type `about:support` and press `Enter`.
   - Search for **`Profile Directory`** and click on **`Open Directory`** button.
4. Create a folder and name it **`chrome`** (with lowercase).
5. Paste userChrome.css file into the folder.
6. Restart Firefox
7. Enjoy your new Firefox!
